					<p class="FAQText">Game Answers is for professional and enthusiast gamers, people who loves games and who needs help in their games because they love it. We allow any genre of games and any beginner questions which can benefit anybody in the community. </p>
					<h6 class = "navheads">What types of questions should I avoid asking?</h6>
					<p class="FAQText">You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page. Your questions should be reasonable to the game tag you have selected. </p>

				<h3 class="headings">Answering </h3>
				<div class="faqq">
					<h6 class = "navheads">Can I answer my own question?</h6>
					<p class="FAQText">Yes! Game Answers has always explicitly encouraged users to answer their own questions. If you have a question that you already know the answer to, and you would like to document that knowledge in public so that others (including yourself) can find it later, it's perfectly okay to ask and answer your own question on the Game Answers site. </p>
					<h6 class = "navheads">How do I write a good answer?</h6>
					<p class="FAQText"> Read the question carefully. Ask yourself what the question is asking and what game tag the thread is relevant to. You can say "You shouldn't do this" however also include a "instead try this". Also try to research the answer before answering the question so you can contribute the results of your research which can back up your answer.</p>

				<h3 class="headings">Tags</h3>
				<div class="faqq">
					<h6 class = "navheads">What are tags?</h6>

These filters can be done by clicking on the right side bar. These tags on the right sidebar are sorted from most popular to least popular.</p>
					<h6 class = "navheads">How do I use tags?</h6>
					<p class="FAQText">When asking a question there will be a list box above the submit button which you have to select. This will allow users to have an easier time to answer the question as they would know the genre of the game.</p>
