# GameAnswers
A social media platform for Gamers

Our social networking website is about posting a gaming-related question and then having other people answer your question. It will also be a place to keep a gaming profile with achievements, photos, and other media that you’ve taken from games that members have played.

The goal of the website is to have a central community where ‘gamers’ can access a wealth of knowledge about games instead of having separate forums for each game on separate websites. It is also a resource to ask a question if the question is unanswered in the game’s documentation/manual/website.

This project won the Microsoft Research Prize for Junior Software Development Projects.
